# Data-visualization-with-WordCloud
Data visualization for textual data using wordcloud libraries using python 

#WordCloud
Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears 
in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.

ord clouds are commonly used to perform high-level analysis and visualization of text data. Accordinly, let's digress
from the immigration dataset and work with an example that involves analyzing text data. Let's try to 
analyze a short novel written by Lewis Carroll titled Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Let's go ahead and download a .txt file of the novel.
